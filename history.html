                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>San Jose State first fielded a football team in 1893 under head coach James E. Addicott. Addicott also served as a math professor at the California State Normal School (now San Jos√© State University). The team played a local YMCA club in 1893 and 1894 and garnered its first tie in 1896, a 6-6 decision against nearby College of the Pacific.</p>

                <h2>Winning Era</h2>
                <p>From 1971 to 1992, San Jose State posted 15 winning seasons, appeared in four bowl games and sent nearly 50 players to the NFL.

                    SJSU's first win over a nationally ranked opponent occurred in 1971 when the Spartans defeated No. 10 Stanford 13-12 on November 13. Stanford would go on to defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl that season.[6] SJSU's second win over a ranked opponent occurred four years later in 1975, when the Spartans defeated No. 15 Stanford 36-34 in a nationally televised game on September 27. San Jose State also had victories over No. 10 Baylor in 1980, No. 19 Fresno State in 1986, and No. 23 Fresno State in 1990.</p>

                <h2>Decline</h2>
                <p>From 1993 to 2004, San Jose State had just one winning season when the team finished 7-5 in 2000; however, the team did earn two wins over ranked opponents during this period. The Spartans claimed a 25-22 victory over No. 24 Air Force in 1997 and a 27-24 win over No. 9 TCU in a nationally televised game in 2000. The Spartans also defeated rival Stanford three consecutive years from 1998 to 2000.

                    By the spring of 2004, the combination of rising costs for the football program and budget cuts from the state led some San Jose State faculty members to advocate dropping football.</p>
